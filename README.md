## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

i learnt how to position elements using translate. Moving forward, i will have to learn how to use css flex to make positioning easier. I had a lot of trouble with the hover effects. I spent a lot of hours on it researching the way to go about it. I still need to go through the code and digest it properly.
I hope to improve my coding as time goes on.



## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank JB Sinluenam. I had a look through her code and got an idea of how to solve the hover effect problem I was stuck on. https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/jbsinluenam. Here is a link to their profile.
